# hello.NET

## Mission

Trying to learn the basics of .net/c#!


## Must have Features
- -[x] A few interactions where you talk to the machine.
- -[x] An if statement changing the outcome on said answers
- -[x] example below...


A very basic(and honestly uncreative) example could be:
```
            Hello, who are you?
            Sicco
            Hello Sicco! How are you?
            Good
            I feel Good as well, Sicco :)
```



## Keep going!
- -[x] Add a Date! And play with it (Maybe you could calculate the age? :o)
- Maybe you like numbers more than text? Maybe you could make a math game?
- (hopefully will succeed) Be creative! Make your coach laugh with your interactions or make a thrilling text adventure!
- added different scenarios depending on inputs from user
